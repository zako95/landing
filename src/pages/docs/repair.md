</Alert>

### Requirements

* [qBittorrent](https://www.fosshub.com/qBittorrent.html) (or any other torrent client)
* The .torrent file of the game you want to repair:
  * [For T4](http://dss0.cc/alterwarez/download/pluto_t4_full_game.torrent)
  * [For T6](http://dss0.cc/alterwarez/download/pluto_t6_full_game.torrent)

1\. Open the .torrent file for the game you wish to repair in QBittorrent, if QBittorrent is the only torrent client you have installed simply double clicking the torrent file should open it right away.

2\. You will be prompted with an overview of the files the torrent contains, select your **game folder** (depending on which game you want to repair) as the download location.

3\. Next comes the most important step: **Select "don't create subfolder" from the "content layout" dropdown menu (in older versions of QBitorrent this will be a checkbox called "create subfolder" or "keep top-level folder" which you have to untick)**.

4\. Hit OK to start the verification/download process, QBittorrent will now check the files in your game folder against the ones in the torrent and download missing or mismatching ones.

5\. As soon as the download reached 100% and the status "seeding" it is complete and can be removed from QBittorrent (right click -> delete).

Congratulations, your game files should now be repaired.

5\. Steam will now check your local files and download any missing or outdated ones, as soon as it's done your game files should be repaired.

<Alert variant="warning">

If you don't own the game on Steam and use the MW3 Dedicated Server files to play make sure the language (below `local files` in the properties dialogue) is set to `English`.
Steam provides incomplete files if any language other than `English` is set.

</Alert>

<Alert variant="warning">

If you don't own the DLCs on Steam or use the MW3 Dedicated Server files, Steam won't check and repair the DLC files and they have to be redownloaded manually.
