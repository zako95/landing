1. Choose a game capture source.

2. Either capture any fullscreen application OR a specific window. The Window is called: `plutonium-bootstrapper-win32.exe Game Title`.
3. Uncheck `Use anti-cheat compatibility hook`.

If either of those methods do not work, you can choose `Display Capture` for a source, but keep in mind it will record everything on the display and not just Plutonium.
